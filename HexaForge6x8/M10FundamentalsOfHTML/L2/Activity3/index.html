    <h1>My Name is Ellen Ripley</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a <strong>warrant officer</strong> aboard the commercial spaceship <b>Nostromo</b>.
        I’m known for my leadership, bravery, and resilience.
    </p>

    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>
        I <em>survived</em> one of the most dangerous alien encounters in space. My priority is always the safety of the
        crew — and the galaxy.
    </p>

    <h2>What I've Faced</h2>
    <p>
        I’ve battled the <mark>Xenomorph</mark>, a deadly extraterrestrial species. Many thought we wouldn’t make it —
        <del>they were right</del>, <strong>but I proved them wrong</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>
        My cat’s name is <b>Jonesy</b><sup>*</sup>. He survived too!
    </p>

    <h2>My Rank</h2>
    <p>
        Officer<sub>LV426</sub> – I was the only survivor of the original Nostromo crew.
    </p>
